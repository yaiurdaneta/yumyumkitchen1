                <h2> Mediterranean Rice</h2>
                <p> Mediterranean rice is a savory one-pot dish that combines fluffy rice with a medley of vegetables, aromatic herbs, and sometimes a protein.
                    While itâ€™s often made with chicken, shrimp, or lamb, there are also vegan and vegetarian versions available.</p>

                <h2>Belgian Crepes</h2>
                <p>Crepes are particularly popular in France, but they are also favored in Belgian kitchens. Belgian crepes are nearly identical to their French counterparts, with a difference: Many Belgians add beer to make the batter rise. That lends the crepe a slightly bitter flavor. </p>
